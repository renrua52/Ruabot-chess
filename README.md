# Ruabot-chess
An 'ajedrez' simulator &amp; bot developed as my first coding practice.

The repository name comes from:
- My name 'renrua52';
- Chess grandmaster Richard Rapport (I'm a fan of him!);
- The fact that it's a bot.

This piece of work started when I'm struggling academically. Good lucks to me!
