# ruabot

An chess/reversi/... simulator &amp; bot developed for entertainment.

The repository name comes from:
- My name 'renrua52';
- Chess grandmaster Richard Rapport (I'm a fan of him!);
- The fact that it's a bot.

# Setup

Run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
